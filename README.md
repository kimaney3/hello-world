The beginning of my journey as a coder
Kehsi Iman here! I'm thrilled to be embarking on this journey to expand my skills and learn how to code! After that HTML/CSS course in J-school my sophomore year of undergrad, I gave up. But I'm standing here today believing there's something out there in the world of coding just for me.
